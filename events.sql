We appreciate your understanding during this time. Please visit healthalerts.stanford.edu for the latest information.   Raphael died on April 6, 1520, and the whole of Europe mourned the loss of God\'s gift to humankind. No other painterâ€”we read in the letters that flooded Rome after the news brokeâ€”was as divine, as inspired, and as graceful as Raphael. The funeral cost as much as a Renaissance palace and he was buried in the Pantheon, the temple of all gods, an honor no other mortal has ever been granted. Still today, 1520 marks a point of no return in art historical narratives, the passage from the extraordinary inventions of the High Renaissance to the precious repetition of forms that goes under the name of Mannerism. Raphael\'s death turned the artistic lights of Rome off; his pupils fled the papal city to work in other European courts. The geography of art has never been the same.  To commemorate the 500th anniversary of this artistic earthquake, the Department of Art and Art History has organized Raphael Transfigured: Three Lectures on the Occasion of the 500th Anniversary of the Great Artist\'s Death. The painter Enrique Martinez Celaya (Monday, April 6) and the writers Rachel Cusk (Tuesday, April 14) and Colm TÃ³ibÃ­n will share what Raphael has meant for them and reflect on the legacy of his work for contemporary culture at large.  Join us on Wednesday, May 20, for \"The Dynamic Gaze,\" a lecture by Colm TÃ³ibÃ­n.   Colm TÃ³ibÃ­n is the author of nine novels, including The Blackwater Lightship; The Master, winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize; Brooklyn, winner of the Costa Book Award; The Testament of Mary; and Nora Webster, as well as two story collections, and Mad, Bad, Dangerous to Know, a look at three nineteenth-century Irish authors. He is the Irene and Sidney B. Silverman Professor of the Humanities at Columbia University. Three times shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, Toibin lives in Dublin and New York.  Image: Raphael.

ICTs, Everyday Work Practices and the Skill Question in Retail Banking in India: An Ethnographic Case Study -- According to a recent McKinsey report (2018), 45% of activities individuals are paid to perform in present times can be automated by adapting currently demonstrated technologies. Major concerns around this current phase of automation include the implications of AI-based automation on human skills and employability, understanding the process of deskilling and reskilling, and the process of redesigning occupations around such automation processes. Barely thirty years ago, similar concerns were raised about information technology (IT), which was considered to be the final answer to “the labour question” (Zuboff 1988). However, historical studies of automation have pointed out that in practice, notions of skill are not shaped by the introduction of new technologies alone, but rather by a complex relationship between technology, work and organisations (Spenner 1983, Adler 1988). In this talk, I will explore this complex relationship within the organisational context of a Public Sector retail bank in India.', 'Dinkelspiel Auditorium', 'Monday, February 24, 2020. 9:30 am', 'Social', '', '', '', '', ''),
(10, 'Thesis Title Architecture Model Based Safety Assurance and Validation Framework\r\n', 'Safety Assurance and validation of complex avionics systems has always been a challenge. Real time monitoring of safety critical parameters during hardware software integration testing is adopted as a method in some of the safety critical systems. Safety Parameters specific to execution platform Environment and specific to the domain, are identified and monitored. This method can capture unexpected failures, but relatively late in the development life cycle. Hence leads to revisions in requirements and design, resulting in time and cost overruns. This can be avoided, if the safety analyst and system engineers could base their work on a common architecture model, utilizing model-based development, to manage complexity. The model can address safety and functionality requirements with equal emphasise. In an attempt towards this, AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) and its error annex (EMV2) is selected as modelling language. The model is named as extended model as it is extending nominal model with fault behaviour. A Systematic method for arriving at extended model is required to incorporate all aspects of normal and faulty behaviour scenarios to be addressed. Such a modelling process is arrived at keeping in view of input and output completeness and state completeness. As further step in model-based development towards safety analysis, safety properties of the execution platform and avionics domain are derived from DO-178C, ARP 4761, ARP 4754, MIL-HDBK-516B and from domain experience. These safety properties also form part of our extended model, with the help of BLESS annex of AADL. The model is further analysed using analysis capabilities provided by OSATE, making it more complete and consistent. But for safety validation and airworthiness certification of the system, safety properties and requirements are to be demonstrated in the actual execution environment. Towards this we propose a framework for automatic generation of safety validation test cases, from the extended Model. The framework is realised in the following', 'Newsouthwales,Viveksplace', ' Friday, November 21, 2020. 12:30 am\r\n', '', '', '', '', '', '');
